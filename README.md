# ZorkDoingThings
This is a twitter bot that reads the [original Zork source code](https://github.com/historicalsource/zork-1977-source/), finds things to do, and [does them](https://twitter.com/ZorkDoingThings).

All in all, it's a very silly project, but I hope it brings you some small joy. When I was a teen, I had a job answering telephones for the local paper, and, bored out of my mind, I would play Zork for hours on end waiting for people to call.

The game holds a special place in my heart, and this is a small tribute <3.
